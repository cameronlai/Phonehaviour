        People spend hours and hours on their phone, watching news, TV series and social networks.
        How much time is everyone spending on your phone each day?
        To find out the answer to the question,
        Phonehaviour was created to allow users to monitor their phone usage.
        Hope this will help you understand how much time you are spending on your phone and apps.
        If possible, spend less time on your phone and more time with your family and friends. :)
